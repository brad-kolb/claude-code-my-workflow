## Abstract

**Background**

Whether mechanical thrombectomy efficacy is bounded by floor and ceiling effects — such that patients can be "too sick" or "too well" to benefit — remains debated and has not been tested across the full body of randomized trial evidence.

**Purpose**

We aimed to estimate the relationship between control-group outcomes (baseline prognosis under medical therapy alone) and treatment effect magnitude across all published thrombectomy trials.

**Methods**

We searched PubMed through October 2025 for randomized trials of thrombectomy versus medical therapy. We analyzed 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) distributions from 30 trials (n = 8,100) using a hierarchical Bayesian ordinal regression model with correlated trial-level intercepts and slopes. This framework directly estimates the relationship between population prognosis and treatment benefit across trials.

**Results**

Thrombectomy demonstrated robust overall benefit (common log odds ratio 0·46; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0·30 to 0·62). Between-trial variability in control-group outcomes ($\sigma$ = 0·74; 95% CrI 0·58 to 1·00) was more than double the variability in treatment effects ($\tau$ = 0·34; 95% CrI 0·22 to 0·51). Control-group outcomes and treatment effect magnitude were negatively correlated ($\rho$ = −0·51; 95% CrI −0·80 to −0·11): trials enrolling sicker populations showed larger relative treatment benefits. Findings were robust across four model specifications and translated consistently to the absolute probability scale.

**Conclusions**

Across 30 randomized thrombectomy trials, worse control-group outcomes predicted larger treatment effects. We found no evidence for a floor effect within the range of enrolled populations; the ceiling effect was confirmed. These findings support inclusive patient selection, particularly for patients with poor expected outcomes without intervention.

**Funding**

None.

## Introduction

Early thrombectomy trials with broad inclusion criteria were neutral.^1--3^ Subsequent trials using strict imaging-based selection criteria were positive.^4^ This contrast seemed to confirm the existence of floor and ceiling effects: patients can be "too sick" or "too well" to benefit from mechanical thrombectomy, and clinical efficacy depends on identifying the population most likely to benefit.^5^

The floor and ceiling hypothesis has directly shaped patient selection for decades. Patients with large ischemic cores, basilar artery occlusion, or late presentations were routinely excluded from thrombectomy on grounds they were too sick to benefit. Yet a wave of randomized trials between 2018 and 2025 challenged each of these exclusions. Trials in large-core stroke (ANGEL-ASPECT, SELECT2, TENSION, TESLA, RESCUE-Japan), basilar artery occlusion (ATTENTION, BAOCHE), and extended time windows (DAWN, DEFUSE-3) all demonstrated benefit in populations once thought beyond the reach of intervention. The 2026 AHA/ASA guidelines have now formalized these findings, extending Class I recommendations for thrombectomy to include large-core strokes, basilar occlusions, and presentations up to 24 hours.^24^

Despite this expanding evidence, the floor/ceiling hypothesis has not been tested in a unified analysis across the complete randomized evidence base. Prior meta-analyses examined specific patient subgroups — large core, late window, basilar artery — but did not jointly model outcomes in both the control and treatment arms of each trial.^6--8^ As a result, it has not been possible to directly estimate whether treatment effect magnitude varies systematically with population prognosis across all published randomized trials.

We performed a Bayesian hierarchical ordinal meta-analysis of all 30 published randomized trials of mechanical thrombectomy (n = 8,100) to test the floor/ceiling hypothesis. By modeling trial-level intercepts and slopes as correlated parameters, we explicitly estimated the correlation between the expected natural history under medical management and the magnitude of thrombectomy benefit — across the full spectrum of populations enrolled in randomized trials to date.

## Methods

### Data Sources

We searched PubMed through October 2025 for randomized trials of mechanical thrombectomy versus best medical therapy for ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. The full search strategy is available in the supplementary material.

### Statistical Model

We expanded published mRS distributions into category counts by trial and treatment arm (control vs intervention). We fit a Bayesian hierarchical ordinal regression model to this data using frequency weights.^9^ At the patient level, the model used a proportional-odds cumulative ordinal specification with global cut-points for the mRS categories and a treatment indicator for thrombectomy. At the trial level, the model included varying ("random") intercepts to capture trial-specific baseline prognosis under medical therapy and varying slopes to capture trial-specific treatment effects on the log-odds scale.

The model estimates three key parameters. The between-trial standard deviation of the slopes $\tau$ summarizes heterogeneity in treatment effects, analogous to $\tau$ in conventional random-effects meta-analysis. The between-trial standard deviation of the intercepts $\sigma$ summarizes heterogeneity in baseline prognosis across control groups. The primary estimand was the correlation $\rho$ between trial-level intercepts and slopes, which quantifies how baseline prognosis in the control group relates to the magnitude of the estimated thrombectomy effect. Because both prognosis and treatment effects are modeled at the trial level, $\rho$ is an ecological association and does not directly identify individual-level effect modification.^10^ Estimates are presented as the posterior median and 95% credible interval (95% CrI).

In plain terms, this approach asks whether trials enrolling populations with worse expected outcomes under medical therapy also tended to show larger thrombectomy benefits — and estimates the strength of that relationship while accounting for all sources of between-trial variability.

### Implementation and Reproducibility

Models were fit in Stan via the brms package using weakly informative, regularizing priors.^11,12^ Convergence was assessed using R-hat, effective sample size, and visual inspection of Markov chains. Model fit was evaluated with posterior predictive checks. Sensitivity to prior and likelihood assumptions was low, as determined by likelihood power-scaling analyses.^13^ Model dependency of the main findings was assessed by fitting three additional prespecified models: a proportional-odds cumulative ordinal model with unequal variances, an adjacent-category ordinal model (non-proportional-odds), and a binomial model that dichotomizes the mRS into good outcome (mRS 0–2) versus poor outcome (mRS 3-6). See the supplementary material for details. All analyses were conducted in R.^14^ The systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidance, and data and code to reproduce all analyses and figures are publicly available without conditions.^15^

## Results

The PubMed search identified 326 records. After screening and full-text review, 30 randomized controlled trials (n = 8,100) met inclusion criteria (Table S1 in the supplementary material). Overall, there was a low risk of bias for the included studies across most domains (Table S2 in the supplementary material).

**Pooled treatment effect.** Across all 8,100 patients, thrombectomy demonstrated a robust beneficial effect on the mRS, with a common log odds ratio of 0·46 (95% CrI 0·30 to 0·62). Clinically, this corresponds to a 58% increase in the odds of achieving any given mRS threshold or better with thrombectomy, compared with best medical therapy alone.

**Between-trial heterogeneity in treatment effects.** The between-trial standard deviation of treatment effects was $\tau$ = 0·34 (95% CrI 0·22 to 0·51), reflected in the predicted treatment effect for a new trial (0·46; 95% CrI −0·26 to 1·17). The wide credible interval for this prediction indicates that, given current evidence, a new trial could plausibly observe effects ranging from slight harm to very large benefit.

**Between-trial heterogeneity in control-group outcomes.** The between-trial standard deviation of control-group outcomes was $\sigma$ = 0·74 (95% CrI 0·58 to 1·00) — more than double the heterogeneity in treatment effects. Between-trial differences in who was enrolled exceeded between-trial differences in treatment effect magnitude by a factor of two.

**Trial-level relationship between control-group outcomes and treatment effect magnitude.** Treatment effect heterogeneity was systematically related to control-group outcome heterogeneity: $\rho$ = −0·51 (95% CrI −0·80 to −0·11) (Figure 2). Trials in which control-group patients fared worse tended to report larger relative benefits of thrombectomy, whereas trials with better control-group outcomes tended to show attenuated effects.

**Robustness and clinical translation.** The inverse relationship between control-group outcomes and treatment effect magnitude was robust to major modeling choices: estimates of $\rho$ remained consistently negative across all four prespecified model specifications (Figure S1 in the Supplement). Translated to the absolute probability scale, estimated treatment benefit in functional independence (mRS 0–2) ranged from approximately +28% to −3% across trials, with the smallest absolute gains in populations with the most favorable natural history and the largest gains in the sickest populations — consistent with a ceiling effect and the absence of a floor effect (Figure S2 in the Supplement).

## Discussion

Our analysis identifies a systematic trial-level relationship between prognosis and thrombectomy efficacy: the worse the expected outcome under medical management, the larger the relative benefit of thrombectomy. This inverse relationship has been observed in observational cohorts, but our results are, to our knowledge, the first to identify the pattern in randomized trial data.^16^ This pattern, estimated at the trial level and not by itself implying individual-level effect modification, has three clinical implications.

**No evidence of floor effects in existing trials.** We found no evidence from randomized trials of patient populations that are "too sick to benefit" from mechanical thrombectomy. Trials enrolling populations with the poorest natural history — whether due to large ischemic cores (ANGEL-ASPECT, SELECT2, TENSION, TESLA, RESCUE-Japan), basilar artery occlusion (ATTENTION, BAOCHE), late presentations (DAWN, DEFUSE-3), or some combination of factors — demonstrated the largest relative treatment effects. While absolute outcomes in these groups remain poor compared to "ideal" candidates, the relative impact of thrombectomy is on par with or greater than benefits seen in more favorable trial populations. These findings align with the Class I recommendations for expanded thrombectomy indications now endorsed in contemporary guidelines.^24,25^

**Confirmation of ceiling effects in existing trials.** We found evidence for a ceiling effect across the range of trial-enrolled populations. Trials enrolling patients with favorable natural history showed attenuated relative treatment effects: when the probability of a good outcome under medical therapy alone is already high, the potential for relative improvement is inherently limited. This mechanism is consistent with evidence from the thrombolytics literature^19,20^ and may explain, at least in part, the neutral results from recent trials of thrombectomy for medium vessel occlusion and low-severity presentations,^17,18^ as well as guideline recommendations against thrombectomy in basilar artery occlusion with mild neurological deficits.^26^

**Clinical implications.** These findings support a shift toward inclusive selection criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, where poor baseline prognosis indicates a greater relative need for intervention rather than futility.^21^ For patients with large ischemic cores or late presentations, the therapeutic goal often shifts from achieving complete functional recovery to preventing severe disability or death.^21^ Our analysis shows that thrombectomy is highly effective at driving both of these outcomes, as illustrated on the absolute probability scale (Figure S2 in the Supplement). The 2026 AHA/ASA guidelines have already moved in this direction, extending Class I thrombectomy recommendations to large-core strokes and extended time windows.^24,25^ Our randomized trial-level data offer a mechanistic account of why this expansion is appropriate: the sicker the enrolled population, the larger the relative benefit of thrombectomy.

### Limitations

Five limitations of our analysis merit consideration.

First, the proportional odds assumption is a simplifying model for ordinal data that may not hold exactly in reality.^22^ As shown in Figure S1 in the Supplement, however, the trial-level correlation between baseline prognosis and treatment effect does not depend on this assumption.

Second, our main analysis focused on relative treatment effects. While populations with poor baseline prognosis derived the largest relative benefit, their absolute rates of functional independence remain lower than those of patients with favorable baseline prognosis. A large relative benefit in a high-risk group should therefore be understood as thrombectomy serving as a critical salvage intervention — often the patient's last best option for improvement — rather than a guarantee of favorable clinical outcomes in the absolute sense.

Third, because we relied on published trial data rather than individual-level datasets, we could not adjust for patient-level covariates within trials — a limitation inherent to aggregate-data meta-analysis.

Fourth, the negative correlation between treatment effect magnitude and baseline prognosis is estimated at the trial level and does not by itself identify effect modification at the individual-patient level. Inferring individual-level relationships from this pattern would risk committing the ecological fallacy.^10^

Finally, device technology, workflow, and adjunctive medical therapy evolved over the course of the included trials alongside changes in patient selection. The observed correlation likely reflects a mixture of case-mix and era/technology effects rather than differences in baseline prognosis alone.

## Conclusion

In this hierarchical Bayesian ordinal meta-analysis of 30 randomized trials (n = 8,100), the magnitude of mechanical thrombectomy treatment effect varied inversely with control-group outcomes under best medical therapy: at the trial level, the sicker the enrolled population, the larger the relative benefit of thrombectomy. We found no evidence for a floor effect within the range of populations enrolled in existing randomized trials; the ceiling effect was confirmed. These findings provide a randomized-evidence basis for the more inclusive patient selection criteria now endorsed by contemporary guidelines^24,25^ and challenge historical paradigms that restricted thrombectomy to "ideal" candidates.
