Dear Editors,

We respectfully submit our manuscript, **"Floor and Ceiling Effects in Thrombectomy: A Bayesian Hierarchical Ordinal Meta-analysis of 30 Randomized Trials,"** for consideration as an **Original Contribution** in *Stroke*.

**The clinical question.** Whether mechanical thrombectomy efficacy is bounded by floor and ceiling effects — patients "too sick" or "too well" to benefit — has directly shaped patient selection for decades. Yet this hypothesis had never been tested in a unified analysis across the full randomized evidence base. The wave of recent trials in large-core stroke, basilar artery occlusion, and extended time windows, now formalized in the 2026 AHA/ASA guidelines, made this question both urgent and answerable.

**What we did and found.** We applied a Bayesian hierarchical ordinal regression model to the complete mRS distributions from all 30 published randomized thrombectomy trials (n = 8,100). The model directly estimated the trial-level correlation between control-group outcomes (baseline prognosis under medical therapy) and treatment effect magnitude. We found a consistent inverse relationship (ρ = −0·51; 95% CrI −0·80 to −0·11): trials enrolling sicker populations showed larger relative thrombectomy benefits. We found no evidence of a floor effect within the range of existing trial populations. The ceiling effect was confirmed.

**Why this matters for *Stroke*'s readership.** These findings provide a randomized-evidence basis for the more inclusive selection criteria now endorsed in the 2026 AHA/ASA guidelines, and they challenge the historical paradigm that poor baseline prognosis signals futility. For practicing neurologists and neurosurgeons making real-time decisions about thrombectomy for patients with large ischemic cores, basilar artery occlusions, or late presentations, this analysis offers a unifying framework: worse expected outcome without intervention predicts greater, not lesser, benefit from thrombectomy.

**Compliance.** This systematic review was conducted and is reported in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidance (checklist enclosed). The review was pre-registered at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/smcen/). Data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/brad-kolb/claude-code-my-workflow. This manuscript has not been submitted to or published in any other journal. All authors have read and approved the final version.

We are grateful for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Bradley Kolb, MD
